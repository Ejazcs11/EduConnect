This is an HTML5 and CSS3 combine project. This project will contain education purposes in which I will announce some soft skills course, their descriptions as well. I will also introduce who will teach those courses. In this website I will make first Home page and then I will make courses page, about page, and contact page. And these pages will be navigate through navigation links in header.


Updating the home page of EduConnect website, in which I added an hero seciton. In hero section I added the website Intro that what we will serve for new learners. then design it in css with grid css property. 

After that I make an another seciton for corses intro. That which courses we will offer. I design cousre seciton in grid in which I added courses card description. and then make the card with flexbox layout and give it box-shadow effect and also apply hover transition.
